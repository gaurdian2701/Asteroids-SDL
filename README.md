# Asteroids using a custom Entity-Component System

This is a project made using C++ 23, SDL3 and CMake.\
The following are links to my **ECS Code** .h and .cpp files in this repository:\
[ECS Headers](https://github.com/gaurdian2701/Asteroids-SDL/tree/main/SDL-Engine/include/Core/ECS)\
[ECS Source Files](https://github.com/gaurdian2701/Asteroids-SDL/tree/main/SDL-Engine/src/Core/ECS)

The folders contain code for:
- An ECS Manager which handles creation, deletion and querying of components.
- Sparse Sets.
- Systems that use the ECS.
- A Component Factory. This simply creates component instances for each gameobject.
