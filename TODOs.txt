1. Asteroid Objects
 - Spawn Asteroid outside of the screen bounds randomly
 - Increase spawn frequency over time
 - If bullet hits asteroid, it should break and spawn smaller asteroids
 - Spawn the smaller asteroids preferably at random rotations
 - Asteroid hits player, player takes damage

2. Enemies
 - Spawn enemies outside of screen bounds randomly
 - Enemies move only horizontally(could tweak them afterwards if there is time)
 - Make sure they use the same MoveAction as the player(should change move action to accommodate more modular input action)
 - Enemies shoot bullets
 - Enemy bullet hits player, player takes damage
 - Player bullet hits enemy, enemy takes damage
 - Player touches enemy, player takes damage

3. Bullets
 - Shoot Action to spawn bullets(should I really make it an action?)
 - Collision detection(prolly make it a quadtree if you have time?)

4. UI and Menus
 - Main Menu scene
 - Health UI
 - Score UI
 - Game over UI that shows score and options to go back to menu or restart the game

 PROBLEMS:
 - IF, SAY, YOU SPAWN A GAMEOBJECT AT RUNTIME, BUT MAX ENTITIES HAVE BEEN REACHED, YOU THEN HAVE TO REALLOCATE MEMORY.
 YOU CANNOT DO THIS IN THE SAME FRAME, WHICH WOULD BREAK UPDATE LOOPS FOR THE GAMEOBJECTS AS THE CURRENT MEMORY LOCATION
 WOULD NO LONGER BE VALID.
 SOLUTION - IN THE NEXT FRAME: 1. REALLOCATE MEMORY 2. UPDATE THE LOOP

NOTE:
 DO NOT CACHE COMPONENT REFERENCES. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
